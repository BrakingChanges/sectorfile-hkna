===== HKJK Coordination =====

==== HKJK & HKNW ====

  * HKJK Controllers, particularly Tower and Approach, should be mindful of simultaneous operations at HKJK and [[HKNW]]. In most circumstances, most aircraft taking off from HKNW will be taking off to the south, which can cause a conflict for inbound traffic landing on 06. 

  * In the event of HKNW traffic, releases from HKJK should be coordinated with Approach, if online, however in most circumstances, HKJK traffic will be given priority.
