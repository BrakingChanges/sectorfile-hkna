===== HKUK Departure =====

  * HKUK doesn't have a dedicated Departure Position, with Mombasa Radar (HKMO_APP) assuming the role of Departure.

  * Hovewer, any departures or arrivals using the VFR lanes are controlled by Diani Tower (HKUK_TWR)

==== Departure Procedures ====

  * All aircraft are required to fly the assigned VFR departure or follow the VFR to IFR conversion given by ATC. Controllers may issue continuous climb instructions to FL145.
