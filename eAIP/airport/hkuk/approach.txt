- RADAR is required
- MDA is 500ft without visual reference

Procedure 1:  
Proceed direct HKUK, descending FL40 or as advised by ATC and report Diani Airport in sight or in VMC

Procedure 2:  
Proceed direct HKUK, descend 2600ft and report VMC or when visually breaking of the clouds then enter wide right base for Runway 19 or straight-in final for Runway 19. 
In the case no visual contact has been established, make a climbing LEFT turn direct MOV VOR FL30 and hold or as further instructed by ATC or contact Mombasa Radar.

**IFR arrivals in VMC**
