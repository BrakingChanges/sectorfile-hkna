===== HKJK Departure =====

  * HKJK doesn't have a dedicated Departure Position, with Nairobi Radar (HKJK_APP) assuming the role of Departure.

==== Departure Procedures ====

  * All aircraft are required to fly the assigned SID given by ATC. Controllers may issue continuous climb instructions to FL145.

==== Coordinating HKNW & HKRE Departures ====

  * As HKNW and HKJK are under 10nm apart, and HKRE and HKJK are roughly 6nm apart, when operating as Nairobi Radar (HKJK_APP), the controller should have full awareness of the surrounding area, and must be careful to keep any outbound HKNW flights away from inbound HKJK traffic, which could cause a potential conflict. 
  * If the HKNW traffic is departing to the south, it may be necessary to delay the flight in order to prioritise incoming traffic bound for HKJK.
  * The APP controller should always coordinate with Wilson Tower or Ground (if online) in regards to coordination for flights departing, in order to prevent major conflicts.
